# Cryptography
Basic overview of classical encryption methods and cipher techniques.

## Symmetric Encryption
Uses the same key for both encryption and decryption operations.

## Substitution Ciphers
Replace each character with another character according to a fixed system.

## Caesar Cipher
Shifts each letter by a fixed number of positions in the alphabet.

## Monoalphabetic Cipher
Each letter is consistently replaced with another letter using a fixed substitution alphabet.

## Playfair Cipher
Encrypts pairs of letters using a 5×5 grid constructed from a keyword.

## Polyalphabetic Cipher
Uses multiple substitution alphabets, cycling through them for enhanced security.

## Vigenère Cipher
Uses a repeating keyword to determine the shift for each character in the message.

## Transposition Cipher
Rearranges the positions of characters in the message according to a specific pattern or key.
